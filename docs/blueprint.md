# **App Name**: Cognitive Crucible

## Core Features:

- CHC Domain Dashboard: Interactive dashboard displaying progress in each of the 8 CHC domains (Gf, Gc, Gwm, Gs, Gv, Ga, Glr, EF).
- Training Habit Tracker: Daily training habit tracker showing streak rewards and completed sessions.
- Visual Trend Indicators: Visual trend indicators highlighting weekly improvements per CHC domain.
- Cognitive Milestone Badges: A system providing a set of cognitive milestone badges based on user achievements in each CHC domain.
- Adaptive Difficulty Scaling: Adaptive puzzle difficulty, adjusting to the user's skill level in each CHC domain. A tool for assessing the correct training difficulty.
- Weak Area Targeting: Smart repeat algorithms identify weak areas for revisit across all 8 CHC domains. A tool for helping the user train the appropriate skills.
- Content Modularity: Modular puzzle design that supports abstract content (symbols, digits, shapes) which can be later reskinned with domain-specific content.
- Matrix Logic Puzzles (Gf): Identify the rule in 3x3 shape or symbol grids (e.g., Raven’s matrices)
- Dual N-Back (Gwm): Remember spatial positions or sounds 1–3 steps back while updating in real-time
- Symbol Substitution Task (Gs): Match symbols to numbers under time pressure (like WAIS Coding)
- Mental Rotation Games (Gv): Choose which 3D figure matches the rotated object
- Tone Discrimination (Ga): Determine pitch or rhythm sequences from memory or detect subtle changes
- Contextual Vocabulary Puzzles (Gc): Deduce word meanings from sentence logic or analogies
- Idea Fluency Tasks (Glr): Name as many items in a category as possible under time pressure
- Stroop Task Variants (EF / Attention): Inhibit automatic response (e.g., tap red when it says “blue”)

- Accent color: HSL(190, 70%, 50%) / RGB(#33A3B7), a complementary cyan.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for headlines and body text.
- Clean, minimalist icons representing each CHC domain.
- Clear and intuitive layout for easy navigation.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback.
